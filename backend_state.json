Let me guide you through the process of getting started.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to Periplus. It's an open-source in-memory vector database cache built on Meta's FAISS library. Periplus is designed to store a dynamically updated subset of a large vector collection entirely in memory, serving queries without interacting with other nodes at query time. It's best thought of as \"Redis for vector databases,\" aiming to enable lower latency and easy horizontal scaling for increasing throughput.\n\nNow, let's go through the steps to start contributing:\n\n1. Familiarize yourself with the project:\n   - Read through the README.md file to understand the project's purpose, how it works, and its current state (it's in alpha, so your contributions can be particularly impactful).\n   - Review the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to understand the community standards and expectations.\n\n2. Set up your development environment:\n   - Fork the Periplus repository on GitHub.\n   - Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Periplus.git`\n   - Navigate to the repository: `cd Periplus`\n\n3. Choose what you want to work on:\n   - The project has several components: the Periplus server, the client library, and the database proxy.\n   - Each component has its own setup instructions in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.\n\n4. Make your changes:\n   - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`\n   - Make your changes and commit them with a clear, descriptive message.\n\n5. Test your changes:\n   - Run the appropriate tests for the component you're working on (instructions are in CONTRIBUTING.md).\n   - For the server, run `./build/tests`.\n   - For end-to-end tests, follow the detailed instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md.\n\n6. Submit your contribution:\n   - Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`\n   - Create a Pull Request with a detailed description of your changes.\n\nRemember, the Periplus team values all types of contributions, not just code. You can also contribute by improving documentation, reporting bugs, or suggesting enhancements.\n\nAre you ready to find an issue to work on? If so, I can guide you through that process. If you have any questions about the setup or contribution process, feel free to ask!"
